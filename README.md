# GENERIC SAND

A programmable sand 'engine' that runs on the CPU. Currently loads the 4 rules supplied in "rules/".
A rule file can contain definitions for elements, along with actual rules. Which define patterns the program will identify, along with a response detailing how the program will modify the world once the pattern is identified.

The game of life could theoretically be defined with this ruleset? Problem is not every cell is activated each frame. (Go see GPU Sand Test repo)

TODO: Rigorously define the ruleset
